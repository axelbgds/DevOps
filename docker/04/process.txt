## Step 1: Create a Docker Network
First, create a Docker network to allow the containers to communicate with each other.

```sh
docker network create my_network

## Step 2: Create and Run the First Container with a Volume
Create a Docker container with a volume attached to it. This volume will be used to demonstrate data persistence.

```sh
docker run -d --name container1 --network my_network -v my_volume:/data busybox
Step 3: Add the toto.txt File in the Volume
Access the first container and create the toto.txt file in the volume.

```sh
docker exec -it container1 sh
Once inside the container, run:

```sh
echo "This is a test file" > /data/toto.txt
exit
Step 4: Create and Run the Second Container with the Same Volume
Now, create a second container and attach the same volume to it. This will demonstrate data persistence across containers.

```sh
docker run -d --name container2 --network my_network -v my_volume:/data busybox
Step 5: Verify Data Persistence
Access the second container to verify the toto.txt file is present and contains the expected data.

```sh
docker exec -it container2 sh
Once inside the second container, run:

```sh
cat /data/toto.txt
You should see the content This is a test file.
